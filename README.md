# Ant Financial, the Unicorn in Wealth Management and Inclusive Finance

---

## Overview
Formerly known as Alipay, Ant Financial Services Group was rebranded and founded by Jack Ma in October 2014 in Hangzhou, China, and is now the world's highest-valued FinTech company. As a spin-off of Aplipay with a well-established presence of virtual accounts and mobile payments, Ant Financial is something more with a bigger vision about microfinance. Its idea is to build a fair, transparent and open financial system, and to provide investment products to every small business and user. The symbolic meaning behind its name also explains the vision well that ants are small but together they can achive something something impressive and impossible. Ever since 2014 Ant Financial has funded by investors and could not move this far without cooperating with many giants in China. In 2015, Ant raised $4.5 billion funding with investors including China Investment Corp (CIC), CCB Trust, China Life and China Post Group; in Jan 2017, it announced a deal to acquire MoneyGram International for $880 million, also formed a joint venture with CK Hutchison Holdings to launch digital wallet services in Hong Kong later that year. Today Ant Financial is the most valuable unicorn with $150 billion valuation.
